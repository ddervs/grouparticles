#### Extension of arXiv's [myarticles](https://arxiv.org/help/myarticles "arXiv myarticles widget") JavaScript widget which produces an HTML list of a group of people's arXiv papers
---
**Usage:** Simply fill in the `arxivId` fields in [`group_arxiv_ids.json`](./group_arxiv_ids.json) with the [arXiv author identifiers](https://arxiv.org/help/author_identifiers "arXiv author identifiers") of your authors of choice and include the code in your HTML as shown in [`test_page.html`](./test_page.html).

See the [myarticles](https://arxiv.org/help/myarticles "arXiv myarticles widget") page for information on input parameters (here, some e.g. `includeTitle` have been removed) and style.
